Programming task Instructions:
Dataset Preparation: 
• Select a time series dataset suitable for forecasting tasks (e.g., stock prices, weather data, energy consumption). • Preprocess the dataset, including normalization and splitting into training and test sets.
Model Architecture: 
• Design an LSTM-based architecture capable of capturing long-term dependencies in the input sequences. • Experiment with stacking multiple LSTM layers and adjusting the number of units in each layer. 
• Consider using dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Model Training:
• Compile the LSTM model with an appropriate loss function (e.g., mean squared error) and optimizer (e.g., Adam). • Train the model on the training set for a fixed number of epochs. 
• Monitor training/validation loss to ensure proper convergence.
Model Evaluation: 
• Evaluate the trained model on the test set using relevant evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). • Visualize the model's predictions against the ground truth to assess its accuracy and performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: 
• Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of LSTM units, and dropout rate. • Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.
Discussion and Analysis:
• Discuss the challenges encountered during model training and optimization. • How did you decide on the number of LSTM layers and units? • What preprocessing steps did you perform on the time series data before training the model? 
• Explain the purpose of dropout layers in LSTM networks and how they prevent overfitting. 
• Analyze the model's ability to capture long-term dependencies and make accurate predictions.
• refelct on potential improvements or alternative approaches for enhancing forecasting performance.
